	<h1> Valentine, Tyler </h1>  
		<p>
			I used to run a chain of restaurants but I found the work unfulfilling. I have always had an interest in computers and technology, and I was formally a student
			at the University of Colorado before dropping out after my sophomore year, so I decided that finishing my degree here, and studying something that I love, would
			be better for me long term than pursing my restaurant management career. I'm currently in my third CSCI class and I'm loving the challenge :)
